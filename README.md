# Ultra StringCalc

The ultimate string calculator, because someone had to solve the string kata
in the most overkill way right?

This project uses `flex` and `bison` to generate an interpreter that will 
do.. well the string calculator stuff. 

Hey, it still seems less crazy than a factory factory.
